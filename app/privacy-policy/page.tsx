            <p>
              Our policy covers how and why we collect, use, protect and share your personal information that is
              collected by our retailers, from our website, mobile applications, affiliates, and business partners. Your

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Policies: The Way We Use Information:</h2>
            <p>
              Kaizen Pro Services DBA Kaizen Auto Parts understands that the privacy and security of your information is
              an important responsibility. We limit the use of your information to what we need to manage the business
              and deliver outstanding products, which includes informing you about our services and other opportunities.
              Enrollment and use of Kaizen Auto Parts products and services is always voluntary and you can opt out at
              any time. This and other privacy principles are outlined in this privacy policy. If you have questions or
              concerns regarding this statement, please contact us at sales@kaizenproautoparts.com
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Information We Collect And Why We Collect It</h2>
            <p>
              We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do
              not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and
              to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary
              to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are
              not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying and
              aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell
              an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men
              and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be
              used to identify those individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
              unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out or
              otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Core Policy</h2>
            <p>
              A "Core Charge" is a deposit for the value of the core that is paid at the time you make the purchase.
              Core Charges are usually collected for items such as engines, transmissions, transfer cases, turbos,
              superchargers, and fuel injectors. The Core Charge is refundable after we receive your old rebuildable
              core back. To receive full core credit, the core you return must be the same model and part number as what
              was purchased. There is generally not a problem with core refunds. But if you are unsure if your core will
              meet our core return policy, then please call our parts department before you place your order. Cores
              should be shipped back to us within 30 days of purchase in the original container that the used/rebuilt
              part was received in. The shipping cost for the return of the core is the responsibility of the customer
              unless otherwise noted.
